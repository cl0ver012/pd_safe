Parkinson's Detection App using Machine Learning written in Kotlin.

This app aims to  diagnose Parkinson's patients in the early stages using Spiral and Wave tests. 
<br>Note that this does not contain the full functionalities of the original app(built in Flutter) , just the tests for the same.</br>

A Flutter variation of the same with additional features like medical record storage and user profile management was made by Team whoami (@Amartya-Khan,@dhaniyapatta and me).

This app is built entirely using Kotlin and leverages the Neural Network Api, and XNNPack Library in Tensorflow Lite to potentially speed up the inference.
